# Independent-Study-2016-2017
The computer science/technology independent study done during my sophomore year at Lake City High School, concerning "Data Structures and Algorithms." 
Specifically, this is a semester-long student-led study over the formats and methods computers use to store/organize data. This allows computers to access different types of information, stored different ways which correspond to the data's purpose. 
This I.S. utilizes the programming language Python to exemplify concepts through data implementation. Learning and progress is demonstrated in the forms of assignments, note taking, and projects. 

# Curriculum
The 18 week semester is divided into three 6 week long terms/units: Exploration into Data Structures and Algorithms, Computational Complexity (‘Big O’ Analysis), and a final Synthesis Project which is a demonstration of good data structure and algorithm use designed by the student. Progress -- overall, per term, and per week-- is recorded in Google Drive, to be uploaded at a later date. Summarized versions of study progress can also be found in the "projects" section of this repository.

# Resources
The curriculum consists of an amalgamation of many resources: "Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python" (https://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html), segments from online tutorials such as https://hackr.io/tutorials/learn-data-structures-algorithms, https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/index.htm, and http://www.algolist.net, and additional information and assistance from mentors including Casey Falk, software developer at Amazon and main developer of curriculum (e.g. assignments, feedback), and Bill Keylon, LCHS computer science teacher and study supervisor.
