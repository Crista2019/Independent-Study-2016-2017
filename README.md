# Independent-Study-2016-2017
The computer science/technology independent study done during my sophomore year at Lake City High School, concerning "Data Structures and Algorithms." 
Specifically, this is a semester-long student-led study over the formats and methods computers use to store/organize data. This allows the computer to access different types of information, stored in ways corresponding to that data's purpose. 
This IS utilizes the programming language python to demonstrate concepts and complete assignments. 
The curriculum is a combination of multiple resorces, such as "Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python (https://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html), online tutorials (https://hackr.io/tutorials/learn-data-structures-algorithms and http://www.algolist.net), and additional information from a variety of different sources, including Casey Falk (software developer at Amazon) and Bill Keylon (LCHS computer science teacher). 
The 18 week semester is divided into three 6 week long terms/units: Exploration into Data Structures and Algorithms, Computational Complexity (‘Big O’ Analysis), and a final Synthesis Project which is a demonstration of good data structure and algorithm use designed by the student.
